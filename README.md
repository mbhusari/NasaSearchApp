# NasaSearchApp


This application is used for searching images using NASA API and to show images as well as details regarding details and metadata for selected image. This application supports paging to keep loading new set of images.

Library: SDWebImage
This library provides an async image downloader with cache support. For convenience, we added categories for UI elements like UIImageView, UIButton, MKAnnotationView.

You will need to have Xcode Command Line Tools installed on the machine that will be building the app. If you already have Xcode it is very likely that you have Xcode Command Line Tools installed. Specifically, we will be using the xcodebuild tool . To see if you have it installed you can run:

xcodebuild -help
If you have Xcode and donâ€™t have this tool you can install it by running this in the terminal:
